# Linear-regression
Regression analysis is basically a process of estimating dependent
variable with one or more independent variables. We have two major types
of regression simple linear regression and multiple linear
regression.Simple regression attempts to predict response variable with
single predictor variable while multiple regression predicts response
variable based on more than one predictor variables.
